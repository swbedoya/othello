I went solo, so the first question does not apply.

I improved the heuristic move implemented last week a bit to improve its 
performance (e.g. I didn't take into account the fact that some tiles next
to the corners are worse than others). I also tried to implement the minimax
algorithm but ran into errors, so I couldn't finish it before the time this 
was due. The heuristic move algorithm, however, at least beats the constant
time player a bit more than half the time.
